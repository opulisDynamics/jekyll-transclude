<h1>Preamble</h1>

<p>
  A while back I created <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/6789">an issue</a> in the Jekyll repo trying to start a discussion around adding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion">transclusion</a> to the native <code>include</code> tag. The reason for doing such a thing is [elaborate here].
</p>

<p>
    I would recommend reading through the comments but the feedback was essentially this: good idea...but as a new plugin. Ok, great. I've never written a line of ruby in my life but let's give it a shot.
</p>

<p>To do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a new block tag with the exact same functionality as <code>include</code>.</li>
  <li>Pass desired content/markup verbatim to the target file for use in a predefined slot variable (e.g. something like <code>slot</code> or <code>transclude_content</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's the propsed syntax:</p>

<pre>
  <code>
    // to do
  </code>
</pre>

<h2>Example: simple standard <code>include</code></h2>

{%
  include figure.html
  src="https://placehold.it/512x288"
  alt="Don't forget to add descriptive alt text!"
  caption="This caption is a very simple string."
%}

<h2>Example: <code>include</code> with HTML in parameters</h2>

{%
  include figure.html
  src="https://placehold.it/512x288"
  alt="Don't forget to add descriptive alt text!"
  caption="<em>This caption is italicized because the parameter contains HTML.</em>"
%}

<h2>Proposal: new <code>transclude</code> block tag</h2>

{% transclude %}
  <strong>Example transclude content.</strong>
{% endtransclude %}
